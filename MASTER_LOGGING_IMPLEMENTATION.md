# Master Logging System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive master logging system for PokerTool that captures all errors and routes them to centralized logs with extensive data collection.

## Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Analyzed current logging setup** across all components
2. **Created comprehensive master logging configuration** (`src/pokertool/master_logging.py`)
3. **Integrated with existing error handling** (`src/pokertool/error_handling.py`)
4. **Implemented structured data collection** with rich context information
5. **Added error deduplication** and occurrence tracking
6. **Created multiple specialized log files** with automatic rotation
7. **Tested all functionality** with comprehensive test suite

### üìÅ Log Files Created

- `logs/pokertool_master.log` - All logging activity (text format)
- `logs/pokertool_errors.log` - Error-specific logs with full JSON structure
- `logs/pokertool_performance.log` - Performance metrics and timing data
- `logs/pokertool_security.log` - Security events and violations

### üéØ Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Unified Logging Architecture
- **Single entry point** for all logging across the application
- **Automatic routing** to specialized loggers based on category/level
- **Backward compatibility** with existing logging code

#### 2. Rich Context Capture
```json
{
  "context": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-10T16:14:23.437316+00:00",
    "level": "ERROR",
    "category": "error",
    "module": "__main__",
    "function": "test_error_logging",
    "line_number": 74,
    "thread_id": "140704656689984",
    "process_id": 10731,
    "session_id": "pokertool_1759335263_10731",
    "memory_usage": 20.8359375,
    "cpu_usage": 0,
    "disk_usage": 90.9,
    "table_count": 0,
    "active_sessions": 0,
    "current_hand": null,
    "current_board": null
  }
}
```

#### 3. Advanced Error Processing
- **Error deduplication** with hash-based tracking
- **Occurrence counting** for repeated errors
- **Severity assessment** (low/medium/high/critical)
- **Impact analysis** (core functionality, user-facing)
- **Full stack traces** with system state capture

#### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Operation timing** with context managers
- **Function decorators** for automatic performance logging
- **System metrics** collection (memory, CPU, disk usage)
- **Background monitoring** thread for periodic metrics

#### 5. Security Event Logging
- **Dedicated security logger** with enhanced data capture
- **Structured security events** with classification
- **Integration points** for security violations

### üîß Usage Examples

#### Basic Logging
```python
from pokertool.master_logging import get_master_logger, LogCategory

logger = get_master_logger()
logger.info("Operation completed", category=LogCategory.ANALYSIS)
logger.error("Database connection failed", category=LogCategory.DATABASE, exception=e)
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Using context manager
with logger.operation_context("hand_analysis", hand="AhKd"):
    result = analyze_hand()

# Using decorator
@logger.performance_timer("gto_calculation")
def calculate_gto_strategy():
    return strategy
```

#### Convenience Functions
```python
from pokertool.master_logging import log_error, log_security_event

log_error("Authentication failed", exception=auth_error)
log_security_event("Suspicious activity detected", user_id="user123", severity="high")
```

#### Auto-Error Logging
```python
from pokertool.master_logging import auto_log_errors, LogCategory

@auto_log_errors(LogCategory.SOLVER)
def solve_hand():
    # Any exceptions automatically logged with full context
    pass
```

### üìä Test Results

**All 10 test categories passed:**
- ‚úÖ Basic logging functionality
- ‚úÖ Error logging with exception capture
- ‚úÖ Performance logging and timing
- ‚úÖ Security event logging
- ‚úÖ Categorized logging across all modules
- ‚úÖ Auto-logging decorator
- ‚úÖ Error deduplication
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing error handling
- ‚úÖ Log file creation and rotation
- ‚úÖ Structured data logging

### üìà Enhanced Data Collection

The system now captures significantly more data than before:

#### System Context
- Memory usage (MB and percentage)
- CPU usage percentage  
- Disk usage percentage
- Active thread count
- Open file descriptors

#### Application Context
- Session ID for tracking user sessions
- Current poker hand being analyzed
- Current board state
- Active table count
- Database query metrics
- API call tracking

#### Error Intelligence
- Error type classification
- Duplicate error detection
- Severity assessment
- Impact on core functionality
- User-facing error identification
- Recovery attempt tracking

### üîÑ Integration with Existing Systems

The master logging system seamlessly integrates with:
- ‚úÖ `pokertool.error_handling` module
- ‚úÖ All existing logger instances (redirected to master)
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker patterns
- ‚úÖ Retry mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Database operations
- ‚úÖ GUI components
- ‚úÖ API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Analysis engines
- ‚úÖ Screen scrapers
- ‚úÖ HUD overlays

### üõ°Ô∏è Production Ready Features

- **Automatic log rotation** (50MB master log, 20MB error log)
- **Multiple backup retention** (10 master, 5 error, 3 performance)
- **Graceful dependency handling** (works with/without psutil)
- **Thread-safe operations** with proper locking
- **Memory efficient** with background monitoring
- **Exception resilient** with fallback mechanisms

### üéâ Result

**The master logging system is now fully operational and capturing all errors with comprehensive data collection.**

Every error that occurs anywhere in the PokerTool application will now be:
1. **Captured** with full context and system state
2. **Routed** to the appropriate specialized log file  
3. **Enhanced** with structured metadata
4. **Deduplicated** to track occurrence patterns
5. **Analyzed** for severity and impact assessment
6. **Preserved** with automatic rotation and retention

The logging system provides unprecedented visibility into application behavior, errors, and performance characteristics, making debugging and monitoring significantly more effective.
