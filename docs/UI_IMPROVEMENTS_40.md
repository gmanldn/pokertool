- Predict potential failures before they occur:
  - "API latency increasing: 200ms → 350ms (last hour)"
  - "Memory usage up 15% - potential leak"
  - "WebSocket reconnections increasing"
- Add anomaly detection alerts:
  - Unusual error rate spikes
  - Performance degradation patterns
  - Detection accuracy drops
- Display health score trends over time (24hr, 7d, 30d)
- Include preventive maintenance recommendations:
  - "Consider restarting after 4 hours uptime"
  - "Database cleanup recommended"
- Add auto-recovery attempt logging
- Display system resource usage:
  - CPU: 12% (process)
  - Memory: 234 MB / 512 MB allocated
  - Disk I/O: Read 1.2 MB/s, Write 0.3 MB/s
- Include uptime counter: "Running for 2h 34m 12s"
- Add scheduled health check calendar
