# Backend-Frontend Integration and Feature Exposure TODO List

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY: System Status Monitor (Real-Time Health Dashboard)

### Overview
**CRITICAL FEATURE** - Implement comprehensive real-time system health monitoring dashboard accessible via 'S' icon navigation tab. This feature provides operators and developers with instant visibility into the health status of ALL pokertool components across GUI, backend, and analytical modules. Each feature displays green/red status indicators updated in real-time by a periodic health checking engine.

### Business Justification
- **Operational Excellence**: Instant visibility into system health prevents cascading failures
- **User Confidence**: Real-time status indicators build trust in system reliability
- **Debugging Speed**: Immediately identify which components are failing
- **Production Readiness**: Enterprise-grade monitoring is essential for production deployment
- **Proactive Maintenance**: Catch issues before they impact users
