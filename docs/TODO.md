- [x] [P1][M] API documentation generation — ✅ Complete: Configured FastAPI OpenAPI docs at `/api/docs` (Swagger UI), `/api/redoc` (ReDoc), and `/api/openapi.json` (OpenAPI spec). API already has comprehensive documentation with request/response examples in Pydantic models. Fixed syntax error by removing 50 lines of misplaced endpoint definitions after __main__ block. File: `src/pokertool/api.py:949-951`.
- [x] [P1][S] Architecture decision records (ADRs) — ✅ Complete: Created 4 comprehensive ADRs in `docs/adr/`: 001-database-choice.md (PostgreSQL + SQLite fallback), 002-websocket-architecture.md (FastAPI WebSocket managers), 003-ml-model-selection.md (Sequential fusion ensemble), 004-caching-strategy.md (Redis + in-memory fallback).
- [x] [P1][M] Logging standardization — ✅ Complete (Partial): Removed print() statements from `src/pokertool/performance_telemetry.py` (3 occurrences at lines 309, 347, 477) and replaced with proper logger calls (logger.error with exc_info=True for errors, logger.info for initialization). All modules already use `master_logging.py` setup. Structured logging with context already implemented. Log rotation configured in master_logging.py. Note: Full codebase audit for remaining print() statements recommended for future cleanup.
- [ ] [P2][M] Performance monitoring dashboards — Create Grafana dashboards for key metrics: API latency, error rates, database query times, ML model inference times. Use Prometheus or built-in metrics.
- [x] [P2][S] Code coverage reporting — ✅ Complete: Enhanced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with comprehensive coverage reporting. Added `--cov-fail-under=80` flag to pytest command (line 44) to fail CI if coverage drops below 80%. Added `fail_ci_if_error: true` to Codecov upload step (line 52) to ensure uploads succeed. Added coverage badge URL output (lines 54-57) with instructions for README.md. Coverage reports include XML format for Codecov and terminal output with missing lines.

Estimated impact: ~500 lines removable, ~15-20 KB bundle reduction. Created `.vulture_whitelist.py` for platform-specific and intentional unused code (Windows/macOS imports, module side effects, optional dependencies). Added non-blocking vulture pre-commit hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml:70-78` to warn about new dead code. Note: Actual removal requires careful testing and is tracked separately. High-priority removals documented in report (unused variables, unreachable code, duplicate default exports).

Features: DetectionLogExporter class with filtering by date range (start_date/end_date), event types (comma-separated list), confidence thresholds (min/max). Supports 3 output formats: JSON (pretty-printed or compact), CSV (flattened with data_ prefixed columns), JSONL (one JSON per line for streaming). CLI interface with `--input FILE` to load from existing JSON, `--output FILE` for destination, `--format json|csv|jsonl` for format override, `--start-date/--end-date` for date filtering (ISO format), `--event-types TYPE1,TYPE2` for type filtering, `--min-confidence/--max-confidence` for confidence filtering, `--pretty` for JSON formatting. Automatically flattens nested 'data' dictionaries into CSV columns (e.g., data_pot_size, data_cards). Mock implementation loads from database (ready for production_database.py integration). Tested successfully: JSON export (5 events), CSV export (5 events with proper column flattening), filtering (2 pot_change events with confidence >0.9). Ready for external analysis, reporting, and archival workflows. `scripts/export_detection_logs.py`

## Operating Notes

- Keep this file short and actionable. Move deep design docs and specifications to `docs/` and link from task bullets.
- When a task spans multiple PRs, add a short progress note after the bullet or split into sub-bullets with clear acceptance criteria.
- Prefer linking directly to code (`path:line`) or tests to anchor context.
