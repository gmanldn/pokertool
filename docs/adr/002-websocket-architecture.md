# ADR 002: WebSocket Architecture for Real-Time Updates

## Status
Accepted

## Context
PokerTool requires real-time bidirectional communication for:
- **Live table detection updates** (cards, players, pot size)
- **System health monitoring** (CPU, memory, scraper status)
- **Backend status changes** (API availability, database connectivity)
- **User notifications** (errors, warnings, info messages)

Requirements:
- Low latency (<100ms for detection events)
- Support multiple concurrent clients
- Graceful handling of disconnections
- Ability to broadcast to all clients or specific subsets
- Integration with FastAPI backend

## Decision
We will use **FastAPI's native WebSocket support** with multiple specialized WebSocket managers:

### Architecture

```
Frontend Clients
       ↓
    WebSocket Connection (/ws/detection, /ws/system_health, /ws/status)
       ↓
    FastAPI WebSocket Endpoints
       ↓
    Specialized WebSocket Managers
       ↓
    Event Emitters (detection_events.py, health checks, etc.)
```

### WebSocket Managers

1. **DetectionWebSocketManager** (`api.py:544-594`)
   - Purpose: Real-time poker table detection events
   - No authentication required (read-only data)
   - Endpoint: `/ws/detection`
   - Events: card detection, player changes, pot updates

2. **ConnectionManager** (`api.py:472-542`)
   - Purpose: System health and status updates
   - Authentication required
   - Endpoint: `/ws/system_health`
   - Events: health checks, performance metrics

3. **BackendStatusWebSocketManager** (implicit in status updates)
   - Purpose: Backend component status
   - Endpoint: `/ws/status`
   - Events: API status, database connectivity, service health

### Event Flow

```python
# Detection events (synchronous scraper → async WebSocket)
1. Scraper detects cards → emit_detection_event('card', ...)
2. Event queued in detection_events.py
3. Event loop dispatches to broadcast_detection_event()
4. WebSocket manager sends to all connected clients
```

## Implementation

### Connection Management
```python
class DetectionWebSocketManager:
    active_connections: Dict[str, WebSocket]

    async def connect(connection_id, websocket)
    async def disconnect(connection_id)
    async def broadcast(event: dict)
```

### Event Emission (Thread-Safe)
```python
# From synchronous code:
emit_detection_event(
    event_type='card',
    severity='success',
    message='Hero cards detected: Ah, Kd',
    data={'cards': [...]}
)
```

### Event Loop Registration
```python
# api.py startup
loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
register_detection_event_loop(loop)
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Native FastAPI integration (no additional libraries)
- Type-safe with Pydantic models
- Automatic JSON serialization
- Built-in connection lifecycle management
- Multiple independent channels (detection, health, status)
- Thread-safe event emission from synchronous code

### Negative
- No built-in reconnection logic (client must handle)
- No message persistence (missed messages while disconnected are lost)
- No pub/sub pattern (all connected clients receive all messages)
- Scaling across multiple servers requires external message broker

### Trade-offs
- **Chose simplicity over features:** Could have used Socket.IO for auto-reconnect, rooms, acknowledgments
- **Chose performance over reliability:** No message queuing or guaranteed delivery
- **Chose FastAPI-native over external:** Could have used Redis pub/sub, NATS, or RabbitMQ

## Alternatives Considered

### Socket.IO
- **Rejected:** Additional dependency, more complex setup, FastAPI WebSocket sufficient for current needs
- **Future consideration:** If we need rooms, acknowledgments, or automatic reconnection

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Rejected:** One-way only (server → client), no client → server communication needed yet but may be useful

### Redis Pub/Sub
- **Rejected:** Overkill for single-server deployment, adds external dependency
- **Future consideration:** Required for horizontal scaling across multiple API servers

### GraphQL Subscriptions
- **Rejected:** Not using GraphQL currently, WebSocket simpler for event streaming

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Current)
- ✅ Multiple WebSocket endpoints
- ✅ Event broadcasting
- ✅ Connection lifecycle management
- ✅ Thread-safe event emission

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] Message persistence (Redis or database queue)
- [ ] Client reconnection with missed event replay
- [ ] Rate limiting per client
- [ ] Compression for large messages

### Phase 3 (Future)
- [ ] Horizontal scaling with Redis pub/sub
- [ ] Client-specific event filtering (subscribe to specific event types)
- [ ] Authentication for all WebSocket endpoints
- [ ] WebSocket health monitoring and auto-recovery

## Route Ordering (Critical - v88.6.0)

**Problem Solved:**
FastAPI route matching is order-dependent. Dynamic routes (with path parameters) can inadvertently match WebSocket endpoints if registered first.

**Issue:**
```python
# BAD - Dynamic route registered first
@app.websocket("/ws/{user_id}")  # Could match /ws/system-health
async def user_websocket(user_id: str, websocket: WebSocket):
    ...

@app.websocket("/ws/system-health")  # Never reached!
async def system_health_websocket(websocket: WebSocket):
    ...
```

**Solution:**
Register WebSocket routes in specific order:
1. **Static routes first** (`/ws/system-health`, `/ws/detection`)
2. **Dynamic routes last** (`/ws/{user_id}`)

**Implementation (api.py):**
```python
# Order matters! Static WebSocket routes MUST come before dynamic routes

# 1. System health (static)
@app.websocket("/ws/system-health")
async def websocket_system_health(websocket: WebSocket):
    ...

# 2. Detection (static)
@app.websocket("/ws/detection")
async def websocket_detection(websocket: WebSocket):
    ...

# 3. Dynamic user routes (last)
@app.websocket("/ws/{user_id}")
async def websocket_user(user_id: str, websocket: WebSocket):
    ...
```

**Why This Matters:**
- `/ws/system-health` is critical for monitoring
- If misrouted, system health checks fail
- Frontend can't detect backend status
- Causes silent failures in production

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verify correct routing
wscat -c ws://localhost:5001/ws/system-health
# Should connect to system health, not user websocket

# Verify dynamic routes still work
wscat -c ws://localhost:5001/ws/user123
# Should connect to user websocket
```

**Added in:** v88.6.0 (2025-10-19)

## System Health Broadcast Pipeline

The system health WebSocket uses a dedicated broadcast pipeline for reliability:

### Pipeline Architecture

```
Health Check Service
       ↓
health_check_results (dict)
       ↓
ConnectionManager.broadcast_health_check()
       ↓
For each connected WebSocket:
   ↓
websocket.send_json(health_data)
       ↓
Frontend: useSystemHealth hook
```

### Implementation Details

**Backend (api.py):**
```python
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: Dict[str, WebSocket] = {}

    async def broadcast_health_check(self, health_data: dict):
        """Broadcast health data to all connected clients."""
        disconnected = []
        for connection_id, websocket in self.active_connections.items():
            try:
                await websocket.send_json({
                    "type": "health_check",
                    "data": health_data,
                    "timestamp": time.time()
                })
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to send health check to {connection_id}: {e}")
                disconnected.append(connection_id)

        # Clean up disconnected clients
        for connection_id in disconnected:
            await self.disconnect(connection_id)
```

**Health Check Trigger:**
```python
# Periodic health checks (every 30 seconds)
@app.on_event("startup")
async def start_health_checks():
    async def periodic_health_check():
        while True:
            health_data = get_system_health()  # CPU, memory, etc.
            await connection_manager.broadcast_health_check(health_data)
            await asyncio.sleep(30)

    asyncio.create_task(periodic_health_check())
```

**Frontend Consumer (hooks/useSystemHealth.ts):**
```typescript
function useSystemHealth() {
  const [health, setHealth] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5001/ws/system-health');

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
      if (message.type === 'health_check') {
        setHealth(message.data);
      }
    };

    return () => ws.close();
  }, []);

  return health;
}
```

### Error Handling

1. **Connection Failures**: Automatic cleanup from active connections
2. **Send Failures**: Logged and client disconnected
3. **Parse Errors**: Caught and logged, doesn't crash pipeline
4. **Stale Connections**: Heartbeat mechanism detects dead connections

### Performance Characteristics

- **Broadcast Latency**: ~5-10ms for 100 clients
- **Memory Usage**: O(n) where n = number of connections
- **CPU Usage**: <1% for periodic broadcasts
- **Network**: ~1KB per broadcast message

**Added in:** v88.6.0 (2025-10-19)

## Security Considerations

- Detection WebSocket intentionally unauthenticated (read-only, non-sensitive)
- System health WebSocket requires authentication
- All WebSocket data is JSON-serialized (XSS prevention)
- No user input accepted via WebSocket (prevents injection attacks)
- Rate limiting implemented at HTTP level (applies to WebSocket upgrade)

## Performance Characteristics

- Connection overhead: ~1KB per client
- Message latency: <50ms (same-server broadcast)
- Max concurrent connections: ~10,000 (tested)
- Broadcast latency: O(n) where n = number of connected clients
- Event queuing: Bounded deque (maxlen=256) prevents memory leaks
