  const handleBetSelect = (amount: number, percentage: number) => {
    console.log(`Selected bet: $${amount} (${percentage}% of pot)`);
  };
  
  const calculateEV = (amount: number): number => {
    // Custom EV calculation logic
    return amount * 0.15; // Example: 15% expected value
  };
  
  return (
    <BetSizingWizard
      potSize={potSize}
      stackSize={stackSize}
      onBetSizeSelect={handleBetSelect}
      calculateEV={calculateEV}
    />
  );
}
```
