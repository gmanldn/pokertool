# Component Version Guidelines:
# - Increment patch (x.y.Z) for bug fixes and minor improvements
# - Increment minor (x.Y.0) for new features within the component
# - Increment major (X.0.0) for breaking changes or major rewrites
# - Update last_updated date whenever component version changes
# - Set status to 'deprecated' if component is being phased out
# - Set status to 'inactive' if component is temporarily disabled
