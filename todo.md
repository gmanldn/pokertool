# Installation Reliability and Testing TODO

## Prerequisites Verification (Tasks 1-8)

- [ ] 1. Add automated Python version check (3.9+) with clear error messages before installation begins
- [ ] 2. Create pre-installation script to verify all system dependencies (pip, git, npm) are available
- [ ] 3. Implement OS detection and provide OS-specific installation instructions automatically
- [ ] 4. Add disk space check (minimum 500MB) before downloading dependencies
- [ ] 5. Verify network connectivity to PyPI, npm registry, and GitHub before starting installation
- [ ] 6. Create installation requirements matrix documenting minimum/recommended specs for each platform
- [ ] 7. Add check for conflicting Python packages that might cause issues
- [ ] 8. Implement virtual environment detection and auto-creation if not present

## Dependency Management (Tasks 9-16)

- [ ] 9. Pin all dependency versions in requirements.txt with exact versions and hashes
- [ ] 10. Create requirements-lock.txt with fully resolved dependency tree
- [ ] 11. Add automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] 12. Implement fallback mirrors for PyPI packages in case of primary mirror failure
- [ ] 13. Create requirements-minimal.txt for core functionality only
- [ ] 14. Add dependency conflict detection script that runs pre-installation
- [ ] 15. Document all optional dependencies and their use cases
- [ ] 16. Create automated script to update and test all dependencies quarterly

## Installation Scripts (Tasks 17-24)

- [ ] 17. Refactor install.sh to use better error handling with exit codes and rollback capability
- [ ] 18. Create install.ps1 PowerShell script with equivalent functionality for Windows users
- [ ] 19. Add install.bat batch script for Windows users without PowerShell
- [ ] 20. Implement installation progress indicators showing percentage complete
- [ ] 21. Add verbose/debug mode flag (-v) to installation scripts for troubleshooting
- [ ] 22. Create uninstall.sh script that cleanly removes all installed components
- [ ] 23. Add dry-run mode (--dry-run) that simulates installation without making changes
- [ ] 24. Implement automatic log file creation for all installation attempts in ~/.pokertool/install.log

## Configuration Setup (Tasks 25-30)

- [ ] 25. Create interactive configuration wizard (install.py) for first-time setup
- [ ] 26. Add validation for all configuration values before writing config files
- [ ] 27. Implement automatic detection of common poker client installations
- [ ] 28. Create config migration tool for upgrading from older versions
- [ ] 29. Add config validation script that checks all required settings are present
- [ ] 30. Implement secure storage for API keys and sensitive configuration data

## Testing Infrastructure (Tasks 31-40)

- [ ] 31. Create comprehensive installation test suite with pytest
- [ ] 32. Add smoke tests that verify core functionality immediately after installation
- [ ] 33. Implement automated testing on fresh VMs for Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04
- [ ] 34. Add automated testing on macOS 12 (Monterey), 13 (Ventura), 14 (Sonoma)
- [ ] 35. Create automated Windows testing on Windows 10 and Windows 11
- [ ] 36. Implement installation time benchmarking to track performance
- [ ] 37. Add network failure simulation tests to verify graceful degradation
- [ ] 38. Create corrupted package tests to verify error handling
- [ ] 39. Implement parallel installation testing across multiple platforms in CI/CD
- [ ] 40. Add installation idempotency tests (can safely run install multiple times)

## Documentation (Tasks 41-45)

- [ ] 41. Rewrite INSTALL.md with step-by-step instructions and screenshots for each platform
- [ ] 42. Create video walkthrough of installation process for YouTube/docs site
- [ ] 43. Add troubleshooting section with common installation errors and solutions
- [ ] 44. Document all installation environment variables and their effects
- [ ] 45. Create FAQ section addressing most common installation questions from users

## Reliability Improvements (Tasks 46-50)

- [ ] 46. Implement atomic installation (all-or-nothing) with automatic rollback on failure
- [ ] 47. Add checksums verification for all downloaded files and dependencies
- [ ] 48. Create health check endpoint/script to verify installation success
- [ ] 49. Implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for network operations
- [ ] 50. Add post-installation verification script that tests all critical functionality

## Notes
- All tasks should be completed with accompanying tests
- Each task should update relevant documentation
- CI/CD pipeline should be updated to include new tests
- All scripts should follow project coding standards
