// The secondary entry point assumes we are working with React 18, and thus have
// useSyncExternalStore available. We can import that directly from React itself.
// The useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector has to be imported, but we can use the
// non-shim version. This shaves off the byte size of the shim.
