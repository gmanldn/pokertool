# eslint-import-resolver-node

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/eslint-import-resolver-node.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-node)

Default Node-style module resolution plugin for [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import).

Published separately to allow pegging to a specific version in case of breaking
changes.

Config is passed directly through to [`resolve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve#resolve-sync-id-opts) as options:

```yaml
settings:
  import/resolver:
    node:
      extensions:
        # if unset, default is just '.js', but it must be re-added explicitly if set
        - .js
        - .jsx
        - .es6
        - .coffee

      paths:
        # an array of absolute paths which will also be searched
        # think NODE_PATH
        - /usr/local/share/global_modules

      # this is technically for identifying `node_modules` alternate names
      moduleDirectory:

        - node_modules # defaults to 'node_modules', but...
        - bower_components

        - project/src  # can add a path segment here that will act like
                       # a source root, for in-project aliasing (i.e.
                       # `import MyStore from 'stores/my-store'`)
```

or to use the default options:

```yaml
settings:
  import/resolver: node
```
