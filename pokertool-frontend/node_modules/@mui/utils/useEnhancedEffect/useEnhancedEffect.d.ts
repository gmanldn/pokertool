 * A version of `React.useLayoutEffect` that does not show a warning when server-side rendering.
 * This is useful for effects that are only needed for client-side rendering but not for SSR.
 *
 * Before you use this hook, make sure to read https://gist.github.com/gaearon/e7d97cdf38a2907924ea12e4ebdf3c85
 * and confirm it doesn't apply to your use-case.
