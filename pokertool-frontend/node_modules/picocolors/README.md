The tiniest and the fastest library for terminal output formatting with ANSI colors.

```javascript
import pc from "picocolors"

console.log(
  pc.green(`How are ${pc.italic(`you`)} doing?`)
)
```

- **No dependencies.**
- **14 times** smaller and **2 times** faster than chalk.
- Used by popular tools like PostCSS, SVGO, Stylelint, and Browserslist.
- Node.js v6+ & browsers support. Support for both CJS and ESM projects.
- TypeScript type declarations included.
- [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) friendly.
