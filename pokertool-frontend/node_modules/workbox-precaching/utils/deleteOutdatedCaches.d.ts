 * (defaulting to `-precache-`) in your non-precache cache names.
 *
 * @param {string} currentPrecacheName The cache name currently in use for
 * precaching. This cache won't be deleted.
 * @param {string} [substringToFind='-precache-'] Cache names which include this
 * substring will be deleted (excluding `currentPrecacheName`).
 * @return {Array<string>} A list of all the cache names that were deleted.
