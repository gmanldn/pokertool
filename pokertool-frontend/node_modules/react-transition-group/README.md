# react-transition-group [![npm][npm-badge]][npm]

> **ATTENTION!** To address many issues that have come up over the years, the API in v2 and above is not backwards compatible with the original [`React addon (v1-stable)`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable).
>
> **For a drop-in replacement for `react-addons-transition-group` and `react-addons-css-transition-group`, use the v1 release. Documentation and code for that release are available on the [`v1-stable`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable) branch.**
>
> We are no longer updating the v1 codebase, please upgrade to the latest version when possible
