# `scheduler`

This is a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment. It is currently used internally by React, but we plan to make it more generic.

The public API for this package is not yet finalized.

### Thanks

The React team thanks [Anton Podviaznikov](https://podviaznikov.com/) for donating the `scheduler` package name.
