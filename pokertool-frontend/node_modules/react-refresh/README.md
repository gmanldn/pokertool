# react-refresh

This package implements the wiring necessary to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old feature known as "hot reloading", but Fast Refresh is more reliable and officially supported by React.

This package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins. If youâ€™re working on one, here is a [rough guide](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) for Fast Refresh integration using this package.
