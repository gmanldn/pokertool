# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in webpack, please report it by sending an
email to [webpack@opencollective.com](mailto:webpack@opencollective.com).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make webpack safe for everyone.
