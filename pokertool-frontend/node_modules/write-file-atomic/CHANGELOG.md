# 3.0.0

* Implement options.tmpfileCreated callback.
* Drop Node.js 6, modernize code, return Promise from async function.
* Support write TypedArray's like in node fs.writeFile.
* Remove graceful-fs dependency.

# 2.4.3

* Ignore errors raised by `fs.closeSync` when cleaning up after a write
  error.
