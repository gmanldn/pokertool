# axios // helpers

The modules found in `helpers/` should be generic modules that are _not_ specific to the domain logic of axios. These modules could theoretically be published to npm on their own and consumed by other modules or apps. Some examples of generic modules are things like:

- Browser polyfills
- Managing cookies
- Parsing HTTP headers
