# `babel-preset-current-node-syntax`

> A Babel preset that enables parsing of proposals supported by the current Node.js version.

## Installation

If you are using yarn:
```
yarn add --dev babel-preset-current-node-syntax
```

If you are using npm:
```
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-current-node-syntax
```

## Contributing

PRs are welcome! The codebase is so small that I didn't setup a linter, but try
to match the style of the existing code.

You can run tests with the following command:
```
yarn node test/index.js
```

The `test/fixtures.json` file contains a bunch of syntax tests, alongside with
the minimum supported node version for each of them. Babel should throw on
older versions, without support for that given syntax.
All the tests are run using `@babel/parser@7.0.0`.
