  - Thread-safe with configurable window size
  - Comprehensive test coverage (17 tests)

- **CPU Usage Tracking**: Per-detection-type CPU monitoring
  - Context manager API for easy integration
  - Tracks CPU%, execution time, call counts
  - Sliding window analysis with min/max tracking
  - 22 comprehensive tests

- **Bottleneck Identification**: Automated performance analysis
  - Identifies high CPU operations (>50% threshold)
  - Detects slow operations (>100ms threshold)
  - Generates specific optimization recommendations
  - Priority ranking system (HIGH/MEDIUM-HIGH/MEDIUM)
  - 12 tests covering all analysis categories

### Detection Systems
- **Blind & Ante Detection**: Game info extraction from UI
  - Multiple blind format support (Blinds: $1/$2, separate SB/BB)

  - Stake level formatting
  - 8 comprehensive tests

- **Suit Color Detection**: Fallback when OCR fails
  - RGB color analysis to distinguish red/black suits
  - Helps when OCR can't read suit symbols

- **Card History Tracking**: Anomaly detection
  - Tracks cards seen in session
  - Detects duplicate cards
  - Hand-level and session-level history

- **Position Validation**: Ensures consistency
  - Validates positions match button
  - Calculates position names (UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB)
  - Position-based validation logic

### Image Processing

  - Detects mistakes (large losses)
  - Highlights biggest wins
  - Generates improvement recommendations
  - Win rate and profit statistics

- **Event Filtering**: Smart event management
  - Filter by severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL)
  - Filter by event type
  - Configurable minimum severity levels

- **Pot Odds Integration**: Real-time calculations
  - Calculates odds ratio and percentage
  - Provides recommendations based on odds quality
  - Display-ready formatting

### UI Components
