2. ✅ Hand format validation comprehensive
3. ✅ Centralized configuration management
4. ✅ Frontend compilation verified

### Next Phase (Recommended)
1. Focus on card/player detection improvements (high ROI)
2. Implement comprehensive test coverage
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Optimize database operations
5. Implement AI features (LangChain integration)

### Build & Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Test specific modules
python3 -m pytest tests/test_config.py -v
python3 -m pytest tests/test_logger_exception_method.py -v
python3 -m pytest tests/test_hand_format_validation_fixed.py -v

# Build frontend
cd pokertool-frontend && npm run build

# Run frontend tests
npm test

# Start backend
python3 -m src.pokertool.api
```

## Architecture Notes

### Configuration System
- All configuration centralized in `src/pokertool/config.py`
- Supports environment variable overrides
- Type-safe with Pydantic v2 validation
- Includes sensible defaults for all subsystems

### Logging System
