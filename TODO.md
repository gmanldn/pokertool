- **Status**: COMPLETED (2025-10-06)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Hours**: 36
- **Objective**: Prevent scraper breakage by detecting poker client UI changes before they reach production.
- **How It Works**: Maintain a baseline library of approved table states, compute perceptual hashes and structural similarity on every scrape, and raise alerts with auto-generated diff masks when deviations exceed thresholds.
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - Created a filesystem-backed baseline library with deterministic IDs and JSON metadata (`src/pokertool/modules/adaptive_ui_detector.py`).
  - Implemented perceptual hash comparison, LAB colour analysis, and alert generation with actionable recommendations.
  - Delivered ingestion CLI (`tools/ui_baseline_ingest.py`) and seeded curated baseline samples under `assets/ui_baselines`.
  - Validated end-to-end behaviour with `tests/test_adaptive_ui_detector.py` (12 tests covering baseline management, comparison, reporting, and integration workflows).

  - [x] Assemble 100+ canonical screenshots per supported site and resolution.
  - [x] Build a perceptual hashing and SSIM comparison service with threshold tuning per region of interest.
