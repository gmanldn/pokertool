## New Backlog Tasks

### 1. SCRAPE-010: Adaptive UI Change Detection
- **Status**: COMPLETED (2025-10-06)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Hours**: 36
- **Objective**: Prevent scraper breakage by detecting poker client UI changes before they reach production.
- **How It Works**: Maintain a baseline library of approved table states, compute perceptual hashes and structural similarity on every scrape, and raise alerts with auto-generated diff masks when deviations exceed thresholds.
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - Created a filesystem-backed baseline library with deterministic IDs and JSON metadata (`src/pokertool/modules/adaptive_ui_detector.py`).
  - Implemented perceptual hash comparison, LAB colour analysis, and alert generation with actionable recommendations.
  - Delivered ingestion CLI (`tools/ui_baseline_ingest.py`) and seeded curated baseline samples under `assets/ui_baselines`.

- **Estimated Hours**: 44
- **Objective**: Reliably isolate individual poker tables, boards, and HUD panels when multiple instances are visible or overlapping.
- **How It Works**: Train a lightweight segmentation model that produces bounding boxes for tables, cards, chip stacks, and HUD widgets, then feed the cropped regions into the downstream OCR and classifier stages.
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - Delivered deterministic multi-table detection that leverages HSV felt isolation, component harvesting, and visualisation helpers (`src/pokertool/modules/multi_table_segmenter.py`).

  - [x] Implement frame skipping if queue backs up
  - [x] Add comprehensive tests for thread safety and performance
- **Test Results**: 18/18 tests passed ✅
- **Expected Impact**: Eliminates all UI freezing, maintains 60fps GUI responsiveness, reduces CPU usage by 30-40%
