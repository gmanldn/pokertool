Shutdown Smoke Tests for PokerTool
===================================

This module provides focused smoke tests to verify that the PokerTool application
shuts down gracefully and cleans up all resources correctly.

Module: tests.smoke.test_shutdown
Version: 1.0.0
Last Modified: 2025-10-22

Test Coverage:
    - WebSocket connections are closed gracefully
    - Logs are flushed before shutdown
    - Application state is saved
    - Database connections are closed properly
    - Threads/processes are terminated cleanly
    - Temporary files are cleaned up
    - Ports are released
    - No resource leaks
    - No hanging processes

Usage:
    # Run shutdown smoke tests
    pytest tests/smoke/test_shutdown.py -v

    # Run with detailed output
    pytest tests/smoke/test_shutdown.py -v -s

Expected Runtime: <30 seconds
